While resolving: dux@2.2.21-RC03
Found: react@18.2.0

  react@"18.2.0" from the root project
  peer react@"*" from @gorhom/bottom-sheet@4.6.4
  node_modules/@gorhom/bottom-sheet
    @gorhom/bottom-sheet@"^4" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"18.0.0" from react-native@0.69.7

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
